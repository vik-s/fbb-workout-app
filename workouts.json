The second strength intensity section\nincludes cossack squats.

The chest and\nback cover most of the upper body and are best trained with big compound exercises. For that\nreason, you will see compound exercises like the bench press, bent-over row, pull-up, and dips on\nthis day.\nToday's first training section starts with higher-skill gymnastics, which includes the muscle up, wall\nwalk, and handstand push-up. These exercises will be included in the entire six-week progression\nto allow you to gain more confidence in these skills. This is placed as the first item in the training,\nso ideally, you are fresh going into this section.\nreps and a TEMPO bench press with low reps. This combination of high and low reps builds upper\nbody pressing capacity across a broad range of weights. In weeks 2, 4, and 6, you will experience\nhigh set, low rest work with the TEMPO bench press. This is a great way to build confidence with\nmoderately heavy weight.\nThe strength balance section will combine upper body pushing and pulling. This traditional\nsuperset facilitates a great upper body pump without detracting quality from either exercise. In\nsome weeks, there will be multiple exercise options depending on your equipment availability.\nThe conditioning on this day emphasizes the same theme of upper body pushing and pulling with\nsome heavy breathing and abdominal work mixed in.

We emphasized getting comfortable in the full snatch for the\nlast six weeks of training. We are switching gears and prioritizing the power snatch for this training\nblock. Each week, the power snatch will be paired with a jump.\nThe first strength intensity section brings back a fan favorite - the front squat and back squat\ncombination. The front squat is generally performed at lighter weights than the back squat and will\nthus be the limiter in weight for this section. This is why a specific target is set for the front squat,\nand the back squat is left open-ended based on your ability. For some individuals, you may only get\na few more reps on your back squat than your front squat. For other individuals, you may perform\nmore than double the amount of front squat reps on your back squat. This may be due to your limb\nlengths, mobility, or what movements you have previously prioritized. Each set should be very\nchallenging, so this section has only 3 working sets each week. In the last three weeks of this\ntraining block, you will see a combination of back squats and KOT squats for another killer leg\ncombination.\nThe strength balance section focuses on the posterior chain since the demand thus far in the\ntraining day primarily focuses on the quads. With the DB RDL and Goodmorning, concentrate on a\nbig stretch in the hamstrings and glutes with every rep. This will help you get a better stimulus\nwith less weight needed.\nThe conditioning section will emphasize single-leg work and plyometrics.

The first two days of this training\nweek have focused on big compound movements to cover the majority of the body. To let the body\nrest a bit and ensure we are hitting all areas of the body, you will see a bit more isolation on this\nday.\nThe strength intensity section starts with a non-complimentary shoulder superset. A shoulder raise\nwill be paired with an overhead press to get a nice pump in the shoulders. This combination is\nexcellent for getting a feel for your delts. The more you connect your mind to your delts, the more\nthey will grow, and the more likely you are to press without compensating with other muscles.\nThe second strength intensity section is all about the arms - a bicep and tricep combination with\nexercises not previously used in the last several training blocks. The added variety in the arm work\nis a great way to train the group of bicep and tricep muscles slightly differently.\nThe strength balance section will target the lower body and glutes specifically.

Lunges require a lot of coordination which is a\ngreat way to wake the brain up as you start this session. Starting with a big exercise like this will\nhelp the body feel fully prepared to attack the remainder of the workout.\nThe second strength intensity section will alternate weeks between a unilateral and a bilateral row\nvariation. Hitting unilateral exercises are great for working on weaker areas. Those improvements\ncan then be applied to the weeks that include bilateral rowing - which generally allow for more\ntotal force to be expressed.\nThe strength balance section incorporates a few novel exercises. The pulling exercise will target\nthe upper traps. The squatting exercise will incorporate variations that help you become a more\nwell rounded squatter.

Over the 6-week\ncycle, you\u2019ll see methodical progressions in both intensity and volume. We start with higher reps\nand more controlled tempos early on to build quality and positional strength, then reduce volume\nwhile increasing intensity as the cycle advances.\nStrength Intensity 1 \u2013 Deadlift Progression\nThis 6-week deadlift wave alternates between Romanian Deadlifts (odd weeks) and Conventional\nDeadlifts (even weeks) to balance control, position, and load tolerance.\nRDL Weeks (1, 3, 5): You\u2019ll begin with 10 reps and taper down to 4 reps over time. Tempo is set at\n20X1, emphasizing control and time under tension through the posterior chain. RPE also rises\nweekly (7 \u2192 9), and reps fall (10/8/6 \u2192 8/6/4).\nConventional Deadlift Weeks (2, 4, 6): These are steady-state sets with same weight across all sets.\nYou\u2019ll start with 3x8, then 3x6, and finally 3x4, increasing intensity week to week. Focus on clean\nbracing, bar speed, and symmetrical tension through the floor.\nnervous system across consecutive weeks.\nStrength Intensity 2 \u2013 Barbell & DB Row Progression\nThis is where we build serious upper back thickness and scapular control.\nBarbell Row Weeks (1, 3, 5): You\u2019ll start with 15-12-10 rep drop sets and finish with a back-off\nAMRAP set. Volume decreases weekly while RPE increases, e.g., 15\u219210 reps and RPE 7\u21929. The\nfinal set always returns to your first weight for max reps (targeting 10\u201315+).\nDB Prone Row Weeks (2, 4, 6): Sets are kept static per week\u2014Week 2 starts at 3x10, Week 4 drops to\n3x8, and Week 6 finishes with 3x6\u2014all at a 21X1 tempo, demanding scapular control. Each week\nends with a max effort set using the same working weight. This helps lock in control and\nhypertrophy in a supported position.\nThis back-off structure helps drive adaptation without unnecessary fatigue while still building\nstrength and volume in the upper back.\nStrength Balance \u2013 Pull-Up & Curl Supersets\nThese supersets serve two purposes: pulling pattern variety and elbow/bicep resilience.\nOdd Weeks (1, 3, 5): You\u2019ll use wide grip, commando, and narrow grip pull-ups across the weeks,\npaired with various curls (crush grip, spider, hammer) for elbow flexor health and hypertrophy. Reps\ntrend from 4\u20136 \u2192 6\u201310+, depending on grip and progression.\nEven Weeks (2, 4, 6): The pull-up variations are paired directly with biceps work in a circuit format\n(e.g., 4 rounds with 90 sec rest between). Use strict tempos to keep intensity up even at moderate\nloads.\nThe progression here lies in volume density (less rest, higher intensity) and grip diversity, helping\nwith long-term structural balance and pull-up capacity.\nFinisher \u2013 Posterior Chain + Core + Carry Work\nThese finishers help tie your pull mechanics together while reinforcing posture and core tension.\nThe format stays consistent (3 rounds, short rests), but the variation week-to-week builds capacity\nacross planes and postures. Expect a little breathing, a little shaking, and a lot of core recruitment.\nFinal Thoughts:\nRespect the tempo work, hit clean reps with good posture, and stay patient in your progression.\nStrength is earned in the subtle details\u2014tempo, control, and volume accumulation.\nLet your hinge and your upper back set the tone for the rest of your training week.\nShort on Time?

The primary lift alternates between ipsilateral RFESS and back-rack split squats\nacross the 6-week cycle, both performed with strict tempo to reinforce stability, strength, and knee\nresilience. Hip thrusts follow as a high-rep glute finisher, while balance work and aerobic\nbodybuilding tie it all together with rotational, lateral, and continuous effort demands.\nThis session targets:\nSplit-stance loading + tempo strength (RFESS, Split Squats)\nPosterior chain hypertrophy (Hip Thrusts, Sumo Deadlifts, GMs)\nFrontal and transverse plane stability (Cossack, Kickstand, Curtsy)\nAerobic capacity meets hypertrophy (Bike/Row circuits + KB flow work)\nStrength Intensity \u2013 Split Squat + Hip Thrust Superset\nOdd weeks cycle through ipsilateral suitcase RFESS, while even weeks utilize the back-rack split\nsquat. Tempo (20X1) is consistent to build positional strength, and volume descends weekly from\n12s to 6s before finishing with a rep-out set in Week 6. Hip thrusts follow every week to hammer\nglute development and posterior chain fatigue tolerance.\nCoach cue: Keep hips squared, ribs tucked, and eyes forward.

The goal of this section is to improve the pull-up. The specificity of keeping the\nmovement the same for all six weeks will help develop the pull-up more efficiently, but the variety\nwill come in the shape of different tempos and rep schemes. Be strict with your TEMPO in this\nsection, as it will tremendously help the development of the pull-up over the next six weeks.\nThe Strength Intensity 2 section will alternate between the Barbell Bench Press and Incline Bench\nPress each week. For most individuals, the Incline Bench Press will be performed at a slightly\nlighter weight than the Barbell Bench Press. Each week, you will use a descending rep scheme to\nwork up to a relatively heavy set and perform a back-off set for max unbroken reps. This provides\nthe value of a heavy set to stimulate the nervous system and a metabolically demanding set with\nthe back-off.\nprogression. The dumbbell row will alternate each week between a traditional single-arm\ndumbbell row and a chainsaw row. The push-up will remain the same for two weeks and then\nincrease in complexity.\nThe Finisher section will shift slightly from the day's focus to get a low-volume dose on the\nshoulders. Instead of putting all the shoulder work on one day later in the week, a little will be\nplaced here to ensure enough total volume for the entire week.\nShort On Time?

The back squat can be a very demanding exercise; for this reason, it can be beneficial to\nperform every other week - like this training block. This assures you are fully recovered going into\nyour back squat session and can bring 100% effort. If you have been squatting for a long time, you\nknow what having a bad day under the bar is like. Not only is it brutal mentally, but you are\nexposing yourself to more injury risk. Although it might not be enough training volume to squat\nonly once every other week, performing a demanding back squat only once every other week can\nbe a great way to continue to see progress in the back squat for a long time. In between back squat\nsessions, we will use the front squat on this day (which is less taxing on the body), and we will be\nusing other squat variations on Day 4 of this training block.\nThe Strength Intensity 2 section pairs a walking lunge and a core exercise. Performing lunges after\nyour squats is a great way to have a better feel for the quads and the glutes. You can generally feel\na stronger stimulus because some fatigue is already built up in these areas. Try not to shy away\nfrom that stimulus because of fatigue; push into those tired areas because we seek strength and\ngrowth. Use lighter weights if you feel yourself compensating or moving away from these tired\nmuscles.\nThe Strength Balance today is a perfect balance for the work up to this point in the training day.\nThe first section was quad-dominant, and now it is time for the hamstrings to get involved. The\nhamstring exercise will be performed alone because using these machines and other equipment\noptions can be challenging. Many potential substitutes exist if you do not have a GHD or hamstring\nHamstring Curl, a Physio Ball Hamstring Curl, Slider Hamstring Curls, or BC Gliding Hamstring\nCurls. These options require very little equipment to perform and stimulate the hamstrings well.\nThe Finisher section targets some of the smaller muscles in isolation. The calves, adductors, and\nglute med will all be a focus in this section. After the big compound movements earlier in the\ntraining session, it generally feels great for the body to perform smaller isolated exercises like what\nis found in this finisher section.\nShort On Time?

For\nthis reason, we are using exercises that require a different type of contraction than yesterday.\nYesterday's hamstring work focused on bending the knee (shortening the hamstring), and today, we\nwill focus on lengthening the hamstring, primarily at the hip. The first Strength Intensity section\nwill pair a single-leg hip hinge and shoulder raise variation. The single-leg hip can provide a great\nstimulus to the glutes because of the demand for balance. If you are sore from yesterday, keep your\nweight moderate, go slow, and emphasize control and balance to get a good stimulus. If your glutes\nand hamstrings are not sore, you can push the stimulus a little harder and load this exercise up. We\nrecommend using weightlifting straps if you struggle to grip the barbell well. The single-leg RDL\nwill transition to a split stance RDL in week 4 of this training block.\nThe Strength Intensity 2 section is our primary shoulder exercise for today. The Barbell Z Press will\nbe used for the first three weeks to establish good core engagement during the overhead press. Try\nto apply that technique to the traditional strict press that will be performed in weeks 4-6. Pay close\nattention to the reps and sets each week. Like the pull-ups from Day 1, the TEMPO and rep scheme\nwill change each week.\nThe Strength Balance section will be the primary arm section for today's training. The movement\nand reps will stay the same for the first three weeks, with the progressive overload coming through\none additional set each week. This is a very valuable and very underutilized method for building\nstrength. In the final three weeks of this section, you will perform a different bicep and tricep\nexercise to increase total reps with the same weight week over week.\nThe Finisher section includes classic abdominal exercises that work well for high volumes. These\nare paired with a rear delt exercise.\nShort On Time? There are many options to adjust the workout today. Skip the section that is least\nin alignment with your goals.
